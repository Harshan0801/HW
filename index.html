        <P>Virat Kohli (born November 5, 1988, Delhi, India) is an Indian international cricketer considered by many as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the game. Kohli plays for (and previously captained) the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He is also a former captain of the Indian cricket team in all three international formats—Test cricket, one-day internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 internationals (T20I)—making him one of India’s most successful captains.
           Kohli has earned praise for his discipline and commitment from teammates, opponents, and cricket veterans alike. “He has changed the face of cricket and how you prepare for the game. The discipline that he has stands out, always,” cricketing great Brian Lara said of Kohli after Kohli was named Player of the Tournament for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.Kohli holds several cricket records, including the most individual hundreds in ODI matches and the most runs scored in a single edition of an ODI World Cup. He has been named Player of the Tournament at global events on three occasions: at the 2014 and 2016 T20I World Cups and the 2023 ODI World Cup. Kohli was also a member of the Indian sides that won the 2011 ODI World Cup and the 2013 ICC (International Cricket Council) Champions Trophy. He is married to popular Bollywood actress and producer Anushka Sharma.</P>
           "World cricket’s most recognised star is at a vital stage in his post-captaincy career. A poster boy for the 50-over format where his innings-building and pacing skills are incomparable, this World Cup presents a chance to leave an everlasting impression on the big stage. Born in New Delhi, a city where hard-earned street cred matters, Kohli has flourished in the most competitive international arena, channeling his natural aggression, constantly refining his cricket skills, and revelling in the hot seat. There are two enticing possibilities that hang around this World Cup: the 50-over format itself in an identity crisis, puffing its way in front of its more hip younger brother T20, and though he is still extremely fit, this could be Kohli’s last ODI World Cup. Now playing as a senior batsman, in a team whose middle-order throws up more questions than answers, his role is of paramount importance. He might not have the big-hitting prowess of Yuvraj Singh, but it will be upto him to reprise the role so wonderfully enacted by the left-hander in the 2011 edition. Kohli will have to guide his talented but inexperienced younger players who are yet to come to terms with this format, and shepherd them home.
